Say 'No,' if it is to be said.' She could really say nothing. 'You are silent,' he cried, with great animation; 'absolutely silent! at present I ask no more.'
<br><br>
Emma was almost ready to sink under the agitation of this moment. The dread of being awakened from the happiest dream, was perhaps the most prominent feeling.
<br><br>
'I cannot make speeches, Emma,' he soon resumed; and in a tone of such sincere, decided, intelligible tenderness as was tolerably convincing. '<b>If I loved you less, I might be able to talk about it more.</b> But you know what I am. You hear nothing but truth from me. I have blamed you, and lectured you, and you have borne it as no other woman in England would have borne it. Bear with the truths I would tell you now, dearest Emma, as well as you have borne with them. The manner, perhaps, may have as little to recommend them. God knows, I have been a very indifferent lover. But you understand me. Yes, you see, you understand my feelings — and will return them if you can. At present, I ask only to hear, once to hear your voice.'</div><div id="kndata">George Knightley  <a>✽</a> en Hartfield <a>✽</a> con Emma</div> </div><div id="knparn"><a href="https://treeoflife.foroactivo.com/u123">❈ 1832 ❈</a></div>
